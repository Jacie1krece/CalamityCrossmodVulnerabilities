# What is this mod
This mod aims to allow crossmod enemies to have Calamity's debuff vulnerabilities, so that your DoT weapons will be better (or worse) depending on what you fight with what.

## Currently supports
* Gensokyo
* Fargo's Souls (Toggleable, as it already has its own vulnerabilities with the DLC)
* Thorium Mod

## Planned support
* The Stars Above
* Consolaria
* Secrets Of The Shadows
* Spirit Mod

### Crossmod debuff support coming soon!

## Supported languages:
* English
* Polish

# How to add support
Just use Calamity's ModCalls (the same as I use in this mod) directly in your mod - I just implement the vulnerabilities to mods without them.

# Special thanks
The creator of Pets Overhaul (Pearlie) for inspiring me to make this mod
Calamity Team for making the Calamity mod and the Debuff Vulnerability system
@cheesenuggets. for helping me make the mod icon

# Changelog
## v1.2
* Finished Thorium Mod support, adding vulnerabilities to all of its enemies
* Consistency: Thorn and Bone Fairies are now weak to Sickness, all Kappas are neutral to Sickness, made all zombie-like enemies have the same vulnerabilities as the vanilla Zombie, made both of Granite Energy Storm's servants no longer resistant to Heat.
* Revamped Champion of Death's vulnerabilities in order to fit its new theme better
* Added a Water weakness to Mayumi Joutouguu and her Haniwa
* Fun fact: Seija Kijin's weaknesses are based on the average amount of weaknesses/resistances of Gensokyo's bosses, that then is reversed to fit her Amanojaku nature. Due to this, she's losing her Water weakness.
## v1.1.2
* Added a toggle to let you override the debuff vulnerabilities provided by Fargo's Souls DLC or let them stay (default: true)
* As a side effect of the above change, also added English and Polish translations
## v1.1.1
* Added vulnerabilities to the Cursed Coffin from Fargo's Souls 1.7
## v1.1
* Added support for Thorium Mod's boss servants and event enemies
* Added an Cold weakness to the Blood Fairy to be consistent with other Blood enemies
* Removed the Cold weakness from the Dream Eater (it's only bestiary flair, though, as Dream Eater is immune to all debuffs)
* Fixed Corpse Bloom having a Sickness weakness instead of Sickness resistance
## v1.0
* Initial release, with support for Gensokyo, Fargo's Souls, Thorium Mod (Bosses and biome mimics)
