# What is this mod
This mod aims to allow crossmod enemies to have Calamity's debuff vulnerabilities, so that your DoT weapons will be better (or worse) depending on what you fight with what.

## Currently supports
* Gensokyo
* Fargo's Souls (Toggleable, as it already has its own vulnerabilities with the DLC)
* Thorium Mod (Bosses, biome mimics, boss servants, and event enemies)

## Planned support
* Thorium Mod (Remaining enemies)
* The Stars Above
* Consolaria
* Spirit Mod
* Secrets Of The Shadows

### Crossmod debuff support coming soon!

## Supported languages:
* English
* Polish

# How to add support
Just use Calamity's ModCalls (the same as I use in this mod) directly in your mod - I just implement the vulnerabilities to mods without them.

# Special thanks
The creator of Pets Overhaul (Pearlie) for inspiring me to make this mod
Calamity Team for making the Calamity mod and the Debuff Vulnerability system
@cheesenuggets. for helping me make the mod icon
