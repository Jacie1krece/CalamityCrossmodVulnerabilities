This mod aims to allow crossmod enemies to have Calamity's debuff vulnerabilities, so that your DoT weapons will be better (or worse) depending on what you fight with what.

Currently supports:
* Gensokyo
* Fargo's Souls (Toggleable, as it already has its own vulnerabilities with the DLC)
* Thorium Mod

Planned support:
* The Stars Above
* Consolaria
* Secrets Of The Shadows
* Spirit Mod

Crossmod debuff support coming soon!

Supported languages:
* English
* Polish
