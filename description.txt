This mod aims to allow crossmod enemies to have Calamity's debuff vulnerabilities, so that your DoT weapons will be better (or worse) depending on what you fight with what.

Currently supports:
* Gensokyo
* Fargo's Souls
* Thorium Mod (Bosses and biome mimics only)

Planned support:
* Thorium Mod (Full)
* The Stars Above
* Consolaria

Crossmod debuff support coming soon!
