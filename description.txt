This mod aims to allow crossmod enemies to have Calamity's debuff vulnerabilities, so that your DoT weapons will be better (or worse) depending on what you fight with what.

Currently supports:
* Gensokyo
* Fargo's Souls
* Thorium Mod (Bosses, biome mimics, boss servants, and event enemies)

Planned support:
* Thorium Mod (Remaining enemies)
* The Stars Above
* Consolaria
* Spirit Mod
* Secrets Of The Shadows

Crossmod debuff support coming soon!
